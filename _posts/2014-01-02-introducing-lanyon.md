title: Introducing the University of York Development Docs
published: true
---

Welcome to the University of York Digital Team's website development docs. A lot of our work is open sourced as we believe in sharing knowledge and information and growing as a development team by contributing to the open source movement.

We already have a large component library called our [Pattern Library](https://www.york.ac.uk/pattern-library/index.html) that we share via the public website and on GitHub ([Pattern Library on GitHub](https://github.com/university-of-york/design-patterns)).

This website is hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com/) and uses a customised fork of the [Lanyon project](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) by the talended [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo).

## What are the development docs?

Sticking with the open source approach, these development docs are a great place to share our own internal 

They help us in a number of ways:

-Allowing the wider world to see how we approach development internally and what standards we aim for
-Documenting progress within the development team
-Starting and growing conversations around best practices in development
-Onboarding new team members who can quickly discover how we work and adhere to our code guidelines and standards

You can find out more about the work we do on our [GitHub organisation pages](https://github.com/university-of-york/) and how our work is implemented at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk) website.

## Editing this site

The site is autogenerated from the GitHub pages functionality that works with Jekyll, a static site/blog generator. There's no need to go to all the trouble of downloading and installing it locally just to write some new pages.

Essentially the site is comprised of Markdown files that can be checked out as part of a normal repository clone. Simply edit the files and then check them back in and push (don't forget the code reviews!!). Once a file is pushed to the Master branch, it's automatically compiled and rebuilt by Github and the changes are live.

If you're not a member of the University of York development team, you'll need access to push your changes. Once you're a member you can also use [Prose](https://prose.io/) for editing the Markdown files online, without having to check out the repository first. 


### Front matter & page meta

You can and should insert the following front matter into each post or page that you add. It's dead simple and just assigns a page title, tells the system if it's published and which template to use - i.e. is this a page or a blog post?

<pre>
	<code>
		---
		layout: post or page
		title: Insert a fancy title for the content
		published: true or false
		---
	</code>
</pre>
