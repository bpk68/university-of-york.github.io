Welcome to the University of York Digital Team's website development docs. A lot of our work is open sourced as we believe in sharing knowledge and information and growing as a development team by contributing to the open source movement.

We already have a large component library called our [Pattern Library](https://www.york.ac.uk/pattern-library/index.html) that we share via the public website and on GitHub ([Pattern Library on GitHub](https://github.com/university-of-york/design-patterns)).

This website is hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com/) and uses a customised fork of the [Lanyon project](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) by the talended [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo).

## What are the development docs?

Sticking with the open source approach, these development docs are a great place to share our own internal 

They help us in a number of ways:

-Allowing the wider world to see how we approach development internally and what standards we aim for
-Documenting progress within the development team
-Starting and growing conversations around best practices in development
-Onboarding new team members who can quickly discover how we work and adhere to our code guidelines and standards

You can find out more about the work we do on our [GitHub organisation pages](https://github.com/university-of-york/) and how our work is implemented at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk) website.
