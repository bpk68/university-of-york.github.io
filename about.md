This development documentation site is a hosted project on GitHub Pages using the [Lanyon theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) from [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo).

The site allows us to document our in-house coding standards, approach to various conventions (such as [code reviews](/code-reviews) and [style guides](/style-guides)) as well as let the open source world see how we do things.

We as a team are responsible for a number of websites (internally and externally) for the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk) and are always looking to introduce best practices, improve our ways of working and continue to grow as a development team.

If you have any questions about our work, you can email us on [mailto:digital-marketing@york.ac.uk](digital-marketing@york.ac.uk).
