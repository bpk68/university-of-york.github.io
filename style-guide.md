When it comes to maintaining large and growing code bases, it's hugely important that the development team is all pulling in the same direction when it comes to coding style. Whilst people may have a preference over what framework they use or IDE is best, the one that affects the code base as a whole is the style in which you produce code.

There are lots of choices to make such as CSS property ordering, JavaScript variable naming and many many more. You could spent weeks just pouring over the finer details of what makes up your styling strategy. 

Below, you'll find links to our evolving style guides for both CSS (including Sass) and JavaScript.
